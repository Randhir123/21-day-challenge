Day 03...

To let people know the current day of the challenge, I'm setting up a [*RubySteps* Standard Time](http://www.rubysteps.com/rst/) web page.

I'm also listing the official days of the challenge, which requires me to print out a list (because I don't have time to figure out a nifty Javascript counter).

Why not write a little program, and meet the day 03 objective?
