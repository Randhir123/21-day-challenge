Today I did...

* Found cause of reporting issue - needed to do an unsubscribe between parts of the program
* Did a presentation on our school reading programme - looks like we got a few more to join :)
* NY got the app running, still need to fine tune it though

* Found out about string concat via << operator from github ruby styleguide - https://github.com/styleguide/ruby
