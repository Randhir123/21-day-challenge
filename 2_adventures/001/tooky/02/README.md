# Automating process for keeping working on the same problem.

Short of time today so wanted to make it easy to evolve the same problem over
a number of days. Reworked my warmup script to copy the previous days code,
leaving the readme.

## Tomorrow

As yesterday, time allowing!

I want to run tests and get results. I'm not sure if its too big a step to move
these tests into something like that now. So maybe I'll start work on that and
refactor these tests later. Maybe a sign that starting with assert wasn't needed
:)
